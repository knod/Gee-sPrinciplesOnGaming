#Gee, 13 Principles On Gaming

##1. Empowered Learning
Principle 1 **Co-design**:
* Playing a game = co-designing a game
* Playing affects the outcome

P 2 **Customization**:
* Customizing the experience
* Good games 
 - Allow you to play at different difficulty levels
 - Use different strategies
 - Invite you to try a new style

P 3 **Identity**:
* Who am I going to be if I do this?
* Avatar
* Clear goals
* Clear sense of who you will be
* Try on new identities

P 4 **Manipulation**:
* Have a lot of control over manipulating the world
* Makes you feel your body is in the game (like leaning when you're trying to turn in the game)
* Offers powerful tools to involve body and mind in learning

##2. Problem Based/Problem Solving Learning
* _Applying/using knowledge to solve problems helps retain facts_
* _Games are interesting problem spaces_
* _Get a lot of feedback_
* _Clearly know when you've "won"/accomplished something_

P 5 **Well-Ordered**:
* Currently say it's important to throw kids into rich environment, but that can set them up to solve problems incorrectly
* Cue them to solve problems in a way that will help them more in the future
* Early easy problems set the learner up for later success on harder problems

P 6 **Pleasantly Frustrating**:
* Learner feels a challenge, but knows it's solvable
* Good design of this causes Flow
* Link from Stacie on paper [about Flow] (http://www.jenovachen.com/flowingames/introduction.htm)

P 7 **Cycle of Expertise**:
* We've seen stuff like this before and in other papers
* Challenge -> Practice -> Knowledge -> Mastery -> Give the learner a new challenge where their current skills don't work anymore and start again

P 8 **Information - Just in Time and On Demand**:
* Just in time: Only give info just before having the learner apply the information, not before
* On demand: Learner realizes they need info and asks for it and then they are provided with it

P 9 **Fish Tank**:
* Give learners a smaller model of the big problem
* Only include a few bits of the bigger problem, then add pieces in slowly

P 10 **Sandbox**:
* Safe space, but feel like you're in a dangerous space
* Explore, take risks, try things without being judged or ranked

P 11 **Skills Under Strategies**:
* Give the learner a goal to work toward and then drill the skills. They feel they're accomplishing something so they're more invested. Tell the learner why they're doing it

##3. Deep Understanding
P 12 **System Thinking**:
* Games are systems of rules that the player tries to make sense of
* Model based reasoning - making a picture in your head of how things work together

P 13 **Meaning as Action/Situated Meaning**:
* Only understand words when they think about how it fits in the world
* Associating situations and actions with the words
